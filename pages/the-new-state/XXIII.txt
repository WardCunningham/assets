THE NEW STATEMary Parker Follett                                            The Neighborhood Group:Chapter XXIII          An Integrated NeighborhoodHOW can an active and fruitful neighborhood life be brought intoexistence and fostered and nurtured? How can we unclose the sourceswithin our own midst from which to draw our inspiration?  And thenhow can the vision which we learn to see together be actualized? How can neighborhoods learn to satisfy their own needs throughtheir own initiative? In other words how can the force generated byour neighborhood life become part of our whole civic and nationallife?  How can an integrated neighborhood responsibility become acivic and national responsibility?  There is no such thing as a neighborhood in its true sense,something more, that is, than the physical contiguity of people,until you have a neighborhood consciousness.  Rows of houses, rowsof streets, do not make a neighborhood.  The place bond must giveway to a consciousness of real union.   This neighborhoodconsciousness can be evolved in five ways:   1. By regular meetings of neighbors for the consideration ofneighborhood and civic problems, not merely sporadic and occasionalmeetings for specific objects.   2. By a genuine discussion at these regular meetings.   3. By learning together - through lectures, classes, clubs; bysharing one another's experience through social intercourse; bylearning forms of community art expression;  in short by leading anactual community life.   4. By taking more and more responsibility for the life of theneighborhood.   5. By establishing some regular connection between theneighborhood and city, state and national governments.  The most deliberate and conscious movement for neighborhoodorganization is the Community Centre movement. This is a movementto mobilize community forces and to get these forces expressed inour social and political life. Each community, it is becomingrecognized, has its own desires, its own gifts, its own inherentpowers to bring to the life of the whole city.  But these innerforces most be freed and utilized for public ends. The CommunityCentre movement is a movement to release the potential values ofneighborhood life, to find a channel for them to flow in, to helppeople find and organize their own resources.  It is to provide ameans for the self-realization of neighborhoods.  In considering,therefore, the various methods of neighborhood integration, it mustbe remembered that many of these methods are being alreadyactualized in Community Centres, School Centres, NeighborhoodAssociations -- there are many names for the many forms in whichthis vital need is finding expression.    Schoolhouses are being opened all over the country forneighborhood use.  In the larger cities, indeed, where schoolbuildings have auditoriums, gymnasiums, cooking-rooms, sewing-roomsetc., the School Centre is for many reasons the best form ofcommunity organization.  In some cities, as in Chicago, thefield-houses in the parks are used as community centres, inaddition to the school-houses.  In many smaller towns or villages,where field-houses are unknown and the schoolhouses unsuitable(although often we find valuable if not showy results in the littlered schoolhouse at the cross-roads or in a Kansas cyclone cellarunderneath the district school), "community buildings" are beingbuilt.  Their name is significant.  They have a reading room,library, rest room, club rooms and usually a small hall with stagefor dramatic and musical entertainments.    And beyond this conscious effort to organize neighborhoods, orrather to help neighborhoods to organize them-selves, muchspontaneous initiative in both rural and urban communities,springing from the daily needs of the people, is findingneighborhood organization to be the result of concerted effort.  Mothers want to learn more of the care of their homes, men want todiscuss local improvements, young men and women want recreation,there is a hunger for a wider social intercourse or for some formof community art expression, music or drama.  Yet whichever ofthese motives leads us to the school house or the communitybuilding, the result is always the same -- a closer forging of theneighborhood bond.  Whoever takes the initiative in organizing theCommunity Centre -- a parents' association, a men's civic club, amothers' club, a committee of citizens, the city council, the boardof education - the result is always the same, a closer forging ofthe community bond.    The Community Centre movement has made rapid progress in the lastten years. All over the country new Centres are springing upconstantly.  That the impulse for their organization is almost asvaried as there are different towns and cities is evidence of theirreal need. I have had letters in regard to the organization ofCentres from as widely different sources as the city council of awestern city, girls teaching in rural schools, the mayor of a smallcity, and young working men in a big city.  Indeed Centres havebecome so much the fashion that one man came to me and said, "Wewant a School Centre in our district -- will you help us to get one- what is a School Centre ?"    In the year 1915-16, 463 cities reported over 59,000 occasions inpublic school buildings after 6 P.M. in addition to evening schoolwork [1].  But School or Community Centres do not exist merely for thesatisfaction of neighborhood needs, for the creating of a communitybond, for the expression of that bond in communal action, -- theyalso give the training necessary to bring that activity to itshighest fulfillment.   We all need not merely opportunities toexercise democracy, but opportunity for a training in democracy. We are not going to take any kind of citizen for the new state, weintend to grow our own citizens.  Through group activities, throughclasses and lectures, through university extension, through actualpractice in self government by the management of their own Centresand the varied activities therein, all, young and old, may preparethemselves for the new citizenship of the new democracy [2].     1. Since April, 1917, with the rapidly extending use of the     schoolhouse as a centre for war services, these numbers have     probably greatly increased.      2. See Appendix, The Training for the New Democracy.   Let us now consider the five ways given above for producing anintegrated and responsible neighborhood. First, the regularmeetings of neighbors in civic clubs. In Boston we have, inconnection with the School Centres, the so-called "East BostonTown-Meeting," the "Charlestown Commonwealth," etc.  At suchmeetings neighborhood needs can be discussed, and the men and womenof those neighborhoods, while getting to know one another and theirlocal conditions, can be training themselves to function withgovernment and as government.  The first advantage of such meetingsis their regularity.   I am urging _regular_ meetings of small groups of neighbors as anew method in politics. Neighbors now often meet for one object ortwo or three, and then when these are accomplished think that theyneed not meet again until there is another definite end to begained. But in the meantime there should be the slow building up ofthe neighborhood consciousness.  A mass-meeting will never do this. But this neighborhood consciousness is far more important than toget a municipal bath-house for a certain district.  If the bath-house is considered the chief thing, and no effort made to get theneighborhood group together again until something else, aplayground for instance, is wanted, this time perhaps not enoughcohesion and concentration of purpose can be obtained to secure theplayground.  The question in neighborhood organization is --  Isour object to get a new playground or to create methods by whichplaygrounds will become part of the neighborhood consciousness,methods which will above all educate for further concerted effort? If neighborhood organization is one among many methods of gettingthings, then it is not of great value; if, however, it is going tobring about a different mental life, if it will give us an openmind, a flexible mind, a cooperative mind, then it is the greatestmovement of our time.  For our object is not to get certain things,or to have certain things; our object is to evolve the kind oflife, the way of thinking, within which these specific things willnaturally have place. We shall make no real progress until we cando this.   Bernard Shaw has said of family life that it is often cut offequally from the blessings of society and the blessings ofsolitude.  We must see that our neighborhood associations are soorganized that we do get the advantages of society.   The second way of creating an integrated neighborhood is bylearning and practicing a genuine discussion, that is, a discussionwhich shall evolve a true collective purpose and bring the groupwill of the neighborhood to bear directly on city problems.    WhenI speak of discussion I mean always the kind of discussion which iscalled out by a genuine group.  The group idea, not the crowd idea,is to come from discussion.  What is the remedy for a "ruthlessmajority"?  What is the remedy for an "arrogant minority"?   Groupdiscussion.   Group discussion will diminish suggestion as a socialforce and give place to interpermeation.   When we advocate discussion as a political method, we are notadvocating the extension of a method already in use.  There islittle discussion to-day. Talk to air our grievances or as asteam-valve for the hot-headed, the avowed intention sometimes inthe organization of so-called "discussion" societies, is notdiscussion.  People often speak of "self-expression" as if it werea letting off of steam, as if there were something inside us thatmust be let out before it explodes.  But this is not the use towhich we must put the powers of self-expression; we must releasethese powers not to be wasted through a safety valve, but to beused constructively for the good of society.  To change themetaphor, we must not make a petty effort to stem a stream whichcannot and should not be stemmed but helped to direct itself.  Do we have discussion in debating societies?  Never. Theirinfluence is pernicious and they should be abolished in colleges,schools, settlements, Young Men's Christian Associations, orwherever found.  In these societies the men as a rule take eitherside of the question allotted to them, but even if they choosetheir side the process of the debate is the same.  The object isalways to win, it is never to discover the truth.  This isexcellent training for our present party politics.  It is wretchedpreparation for the kind of politics we wish to see in America,because there is no attempt to think together.  Someone to whom Isaid this replied, "But each side has to think together."  Not inthe least: they simply pool their information and their arguments,they don't think together.   They don't even think; that artificialmental process of maintaining a thesis which is not yours byconviction is not thinking.  In debating you are always trying tofind the ideas and facts which will support your side; you do notlook dispassionately at all ideas and all facts, and try to makeout just where the truth lies.  You do not try to see what ideas ofyour opponent will enrich your own point of view; you are bound toreject without examination his views, his ideas, almost I might sayhis facts.  In a discussion you can be flexible, you can tryexperiments, you can grow as the group grows, but in a debate allthis is impossible.    One of the great advantages of the forum movement is that here weare beginning to have discussion [1].     1. That it is also in many instances leading the way to real     community organization makes it one of the most valuable     movements of our time.  Let us analyze briefly the advantages of discussion. Genuinediscussion is truth-seeking.   First, then, it presses every man tothink clearly and appreciatively and discriminatingly in order totake his part worthily. What we need above everything else is clearthinking. This need has been covered over by the demand for"honest" men, but hardly any one would say to-day, "Give themanagement of your city over to a group of the most honest men youcan find."  A group of honest men -- what a disconcerting picturethe phrase calls up!  We want efficient men, thinking men, as wellas honest men. Take care of your thinking and your morals will takecare of themselves -- is a present which would have benefitedcertain reform campaigns.    The first advantage of discussion then is that it tends to makeus think and to seek accurate information in order to be able tothink and to think clearly.  I belong to a civic conference lunchclub which meets once a month to discuss civic questions. On oneoccasion the program committee discovered a few days before theluncheon that on the question to be considered (a certain billbefore the legislature), we were all of the same opinion, and sothe discussion did not seem likely to be very lively.  But ithappened that our secretary knew some one who was on the otherside, and this woman was therefore invited to be our guest and present her point of view to us.  She accepted with pleasure as shesaid she felt strongly on the matter.  On the morning of the day ofour meeting, however, she telephoned that she could not come, asshe had just read the bill, thinking it would be wise to do sobefore she publicly opposed it, and she found she agreed with itheartily!  Moreover, no one question can be adequately discussed without anunderstanding of many more.  Remedies for abuses are seldom directbecause every abuse is bound up with our whole political andeconomic system. And if discussion induces thinking by thepreparation necessary, it certainly stimulates thinking by theopposition we meet.    But the great advantage of discussion is that thereby we overcomemisunderstanding and conquer prejudice. An Englishman who visitedAmerica last winter said that he had seen in an American newspaperthis advice, "Get acquainted with your neighbor, you might likehim," and was much struck with the difference between the Americanand the English way of looking at the matter.  The Englishman, hesaid, does not get acquainted with his neighbor for fear he mightlike him! I sometimes feel that we refuse to get acquainted withthe arguments of our opponents for fear we might sympathize withthem.  Genuine discussion, however, will always and should always bringout difference, but at the same time it teaches us what to do withdifference. The formative process which takes place in discussionis that unceasing reciprocal adjustment which brings out and givesform to truth.  The whole conception of discussion is now changing. Discussion isto be the sharpest, most effective political tool of the future. The value of the town-meeting is not in the fact that every onegoes, but in what every one does when he gets there.  Anddiscussion will overcome much indifference, much complacency.     We must remember that most people are not for or against anything;the first object of getting people together is to make them respondsomehow, to overcome inertia.  To disagree, as well as to agree,with people brings you closer to them.  I always feel intimate withmy enemies.  It is not opposition but indifference which separatesmen.    Another advantage of discussion in regular meetings of neighborsis that men discuss questions there before they come to a politicalissue, when there is not the heat of the actual fight and thedesire to win.    Through regular meetings then, and a genuine discussion, we helpto forge the neighborhood bond. But this is not enough.  A truecommunity life should be developed. If the multiplicity andcomplexity of interrelations of interests and wants and hopes areto be brought to the surface to form the substance of politics,people must come more and more to live their lives together. We areignorant: we should form classes and learn together. The farmer inVirginia goes to the School Centre to learn how to test his seedcorn.  We need social intercourse: we should meet to exchangeexperiences and to have a "good time" together.  We needopportunity for bringing old and young together, parents andchildren, for boys and girls to meet in a natural, healthy way. Weneed true recreation, not the passive looking at the motionpictures, not the deadening watching of other people's acting; wewant the real re-creation of active participation.  The leisuretime of men and women is being increased by legislation, byvocational efficiency, by machinery, and by scientific management. One of the most pressing needs of to-day is the constructive use ofleisure.  This need can be largely satisfied in the NeighborhoodCentre.   Festivals, pageants, the celebration of holidays can allbe used as recreation, as a means of self-expression, and ofbuilding up the neighborhood bond.     Here too the family realizes that its life is embedded in alarger life, and the richer that larger life the more the familygains.  The family learns its duty to other families, and it findsthat its external relations change all its inner life, as theInternational League will change fundamentally the internal historyof every nation.   I knew two sisters who were ashamed of theirmother until they could say to their friends, "Mother goes to thelectures every Saturday night at the School Centre." I know men andwives who never went out together until they found an extended homein a School Centre. I know a father, an intelligent policeman, whonever had any real friendship with his four daughters until heplanned dances for them at the School Centre so that they shouldnot go to the public dance halls.     Families often need some means of coming to a commonunderstanding; they are not always capable by themselves of makingthe necessary adjustment of points of view brought from so manysources as the different family outgoings produce. For example,food conservation taught in various ways in the Neighborhood Centre-- by cooking classes for women, by lectures for both men and womenshowing the relation of food to the whole present world problem, byhaving regular afternoons for meeting with agents from the HealthDepartment, by comparison between neighbors of the results of thenew feeding -- food conservation, that is, taught as a communityproblem, is more effective than taught merely to classes ofmothers.  For if the mother makes dishes the father and childrenrefuse to eat, the cooking classes she has attended will have nocommunity value. To give community value to all our apparentlyisolated activities is one of the primary objects of neighborhoodorganization.   The Neighborhood Centre, therefore, instead of separatingfamilies, as sometimes feared, is uniting them. To live their lifein the setting of the broader life is continuously to interpret andexplain one to the other. And if we have learned that sacred as ourfamily life must always be, the significance of that sacredness isits power of contributing to the life around us, the life of ourlittle neighborhood, then we are ready to understand that thenation too is real, that its tasks are mighty and that those taskswill not be performed unless every one of us can findself-expression through the nation's needs.   We have seen that the regular meeting of neighbors gives anexternal integration of neighborhood life. We have seen that groupdiscussion begins to forge a real neighborhood bond. We have seenthat a sharing of our daily life -- its cares and burdens, itspleasures and joys, each with all -- furthers this inner, thisspiritual union which is at last to be the core of a new politics. The fourth way of developing the neighborhood bond is by citizenstaking more and more responsibility for the life of theircommunity. This will mean a moral integration. We are not to digdown into our life to find our true needs and then demand thatgovernment satisfy those needs -- the satisfaction also must befound in that fermenting life from which our demands issue.   Themethods of neighborhood responsibility will be discussed in chapterXXVI.   The fifth way of developing the neighborhood group is byestablishing some regular connection between the neighborhood andcity, state and national governments. Then shall we have thepolitical integration of the neighborhood.  This will be discussedin chapter XXVII, "From Neighborhood to Nation."  Party politicsare organized, "interests" are organized, our citizenship is notorganized.  Our neighborhood life is starving for lack of any realpart in the state.  Give us that part and as inevitably as the wakefollows the ship will neighborhood responsibility follow theintegration of neighborhood and state.
