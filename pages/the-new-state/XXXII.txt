THE NEW STATEBy Mary Parker FollettThe Occupational Group:  Chapter XXXIIPolitical Pluralism (concluded)I HAVE spoken of the endeavor of the pluralist school to look atthings as they are as one of its excellencies.  But a progressivepolitical science must also decide what it is aiming at. It is nological argument against a sovereign state to say that we have notone at present or that our present particularistic states are notsuccessful.  Proof of actual plural sovereignty does not constitutean argument against the ideal of unified or rather a unifyingsovereignty. The question is do we want a unifying state?  And ifso, how can we set about getting it?  The old theory of the monistic state indeed tended to make thestate absolute. The pluralists are justified in their fear of aunified state when they conceive it as a monster which hasswallowed up everything within sight.  It reminds one of thenursery rhyme of one's childhood:                     Algy met a bear                     The bear was bulgy                     The bulge was Algy.The pluralists say that the monistic state _absorbs_ its members.(This is a word used by many writers) [1]. But the ideal unifiedstate is not all-absorptive; it is all-inclusive -- a verydifferent matter: we are not, individual or group, to be absorbedinto a whole, we are to be constituent members of the whole. I amspeaking throughout of the ideal unified state, which I call aunifying state.     1.  p 39 note.  The failure to understand a unifying state is responsible for thedread on the one hand of a state which will "demand" ourallegiance, and on the other of our being left to the clash of"divided" allegiances. Both these bugbears will disappear onlythrough an understanding of how each allegiance can minister toevery other, and also through a realization that no single groupcan embrace my life. It is true that the state as state no morethan family or trade-union or church can "capture my soul." Butthis does not mean that I must divide my allegiance; I must findhow I can by being loyal to each be loyal to all, to the whole. Iam an American with all my heart and soul and at the same time Ican work daily for Boston and Massachusetts.  I can work for mynation through local machinery of city or neighborhood. My work atoffice or factory enriches my family life; my duty to my family ismy most pressing incentive to do my best work. There is nocompeting here, but an infinite number of filaments cross andrecross and connect all my various allegiances. We should not beobliged to choose between our different groups. Competition is notthe soul of true federalism but the interlocking of all interestsand all activities.  The true state must gather up every interest within itself. Itmust take our many loyalties and find how it can make them one. Ihave all these different allegiances, I should indeed lead adivided and therefore uninteresting life if I could not unify them,Life _would_ be "just one damned thing after another."  The truestate has my devotion because it gathers up into itself the varioussides of me, is the symbol of my multiple self, is my multiple selfbrought to significance, to self-realization. If you leave me withmy plural selves, you leave me in desolate places, my soul cravingits meaning, its home. The home of my soul is in the state.  But the true state does not "demand" my allegiance. It is thespontaneously uniting, the instinctive self-unifying of ourmultiple interests. And as it does not "demand" allegiance, so alsoit does not "compete" with trade-unions etc., as the present stateoften does, for my allegiance. We have been recently told that thetendency of the state is to be intolerant of "any competinginterest or faith or hope," but if it is, the cure is not to makeit tolerant, but to make it recognize that the very substance ofits life is all these interests and faiths and hopes. Every groupwhich we join must increase our loyalty to the state because thestate must recognize fully every legitimate interest. Our politicalmachinery must not be such that I get what I need by pitting thegroup which most clearly embodies my need against the state; itmust be such that my loyalty to my trade-union is truly part of myloyalty to the state.  When I find that my loyalty to my group and my loyalty to thestate conflict (if I am a Quaker and my country is at war, or if Iam a trade-unionist and the commands of nation and trade-unionclash at the time of a strike), I must usually, as a matter ofimmediate action, decide between these loyalties. But my duty toeither group or state is not thereby exhausted: I must, if mydisapproval of war is to be neither abandoned nor remain a mereparticularist conviction, seek to change the policy of my state inregard to its foreign relations; I must, knowing that there can beno sound national life where trade-unions are pitted against thestate, seek to bring about those changes in our industrial andpolitical organization by which the interests of my trade-union canbecome a constituent part of the interests of the state.  I feel capable of more than a multiple allegiance, I feel capableof a unified allegiance. A unified allegiance the new state willclaim, but that is something very different from an "undivided"allegiance. It is, to use James' phrase again, a compounding ofallegiances. "Multiple allegiance" leaves us with the abnormal ideaof competing groups. "Supplementary allegiance" gives us toofragmentary an existence. "Cooperative allegiance" comes nearer thetruth. Can we not perhaps imagine a cooperative or unifiedallegiance, all these various and varying allegiances actuallyliving in and through the other?  We need not fear the state if we could understand it as theunifying power: it is the state-principle when two or three aregathered together, when any differences are harmonized.  Ourproblem is how all the separate community sense and communityloyalty and community responsibility can be gathered up into largercommunity sense and loyalty and control.  One thing more it is necessary to bear in mind in considering theunified state, and that is that a unifying state is not a staticstate. We, organized as the state, may issue certain commands toourselves today, but organized as a plastic state, those commandsmay change to-morrow with our changing needs and changing ideals,and they will change through _our_ initiative. The true state isneither an external force nor an unchanging force.  Rooted in ourmost intimate daily lives, in those bonds which are at the sametime the strongest and the most pliant, the "absolutism" of thetrue state depends always upon _our_ activity.  The objectors tothe unified state seem to imply that it is necessarily a ready-madestate, with hard and fast articulations, existing apart from us,imposing its commands upon us which we must obey; but the truth isthat the state must be in perfect flux and that it is utterlydependent upon us for its appearance. In so far as we actualize it,it appears to us; we recognize that it is wrong, then we see it ina higher form and actualize that. The true state is not anarbitrary creation. It is a process: a continual self-modificationto express its different stages of growth which each and all mustbe so flexible that continual change of form is twin-fellow ofcontinual growth.  But every objection that can be raised against the pluralistsdoes not I believe take from them the right to leadership inpolitical thought.  First, they prick the bubble of the present state's right tosupremacy. They see that the state which has been slowly formingsince the Middle Ages with its pretenses and unfulfilled claims hasnot won either our regard or respect. Why then, they ask, should werender this state obedience? "[The state must] prove itself by whatit achieves." With the latter we are all beginning to agree.  Genuine power, in the sense not of power actually possessed, butin the sense of a properly evolved power, is, we have seen, anactual psychological process. Invaluable, therefore, is theimplicit warning of the pluralists that to attain this power is aninfinite task.  Sovereignty is always a-growing; our politicalforms must keep closely in touch with the specific stage of thatgrowth. In rendering the state obedience, we assume that the statehas genuine power (because the consequences of an oppositeassumption would be too disastrous) while we are trying toapproximate it. The great lesson of Mr. Laski's book is in itsimplication that we do not have a sovereign state until we makeone. Political theory will not _create_ sovereignty, acts ofParliament cannot _confer_ sovereignty, only living the life willturn us, subjects indeed at present, into kings of our own destiny.  Moreover, recently some of the pluralists are beginning to usethe phrase cooperative sovereignty [1] which seems happily to betaking them away from their earlier "strung-along' sovereignty.  Ifthey press along this path, we shall all be eager to follow.     1. Mr. Laski, I think.  Secondly, they recognize the value of the group and they see thatthe variety of our group life to-day has a significance which mustbe immediately reckoned with in political method. Moreover theyrepudiate the idea that the groups are given authority by thestate. An able political writer recently said, "All other societiesrest on the authority given by the state.  The state itself standsself-sufficient, self-directing. . . ."  It is this school ofthought which the pluralists are combating and thereby renderinginvaluable service to political theory.  Third, and directly connected with the last point, they plead fora revivification of local life. It is interesting to note that thenecessity of this is recognized both by those who think the statehas failed and by those who wish to increase the power of thestate. To the former, the group is to be the substitute for therepudiated state. As for the latter, the Fabians have long feltthat local units should be vitalized and educated and interested,for they thought that socialism would begin with the city and otherlocal units. Neighborhood education and neighborhood organizationis then the pressing problem of 1918. All those who are lookingtowards a real democracy, not the pretense of one which we havenow, feel that the most imminent of our needs is the awakening andinvigorating, the educating and organizing of the local unit. Allthose who in the humblest way, in settlement or community centre,are working for this, are working at the greatest political problemof the twentieth century.  In the fourth place the pluralists see that the interest of thestate is not now always identical with the interests of its parts.It is to the interest of England to win this war, they say, butEngland has yet to prove that it is also for the interest of herworking people.  In the fifth place, we may hail the group school as the beginningof the disappearance of the crowd.  Many people advocate vocationalrepresentation because they see in it a method of getting away fromour present crowd rule, what they call numerical representation.They see our present voters hypnotized by their leaders andmanipulated by "interests," and propose the occupational group asa substitute for the crowd. New political experiments must indeedbe along this line. We must guard only (1) that the "group" itselfshall not be a crowd, (2) that the union of groups shall not be anumerical union.  Finally, this new school contains the prophecy of the futurebecause it has with keenest insight seized upon the problem ofidentity, of association, of federalism [1], as the central problemof politics as it is the central problem of life. The force of thepluralist school is that it is not academic; it is considering aquestion which every thoughtful person is asking himself.  We arefaced to-day with a variety of group interests, with many objectsdemanding our enthusiasm and devotion; our duty itself shines, nota single light showing a single path, but shedding a largerradiance on a life which is most gloriously not a path at all.Shall Boston or Washington hold me, my family, my church, my union?With the complexity of interests increasing every day on theoutside, inside with the power of the soul to "belong" expandingevery day (the English and the French flags stir us hardly lessthan the American now), with the psychologists talking of pluralismand the political scientists of multiple sovereignty, with all thisyet the soul of man seeks unity in obedience to his essentialnature. How is this to be obtained? Social evolution is in thehands of those who can solve this problem.     1. It does not matter in the terms of which branch of study     you express it -- philosophy, sociology, or political science     -- it is always the same problem.  What is the law of politics that corresponds in importance to thelaw of gravitation in the physical world? It is the law ofinterpenetration and of multiples. I am the multiple man and themultiple man is the germ of the unified state. If I live fully Ibecome so enriched by the manifold sides of life that I cannot benarrowed down to mere corporation or church or trade-union or anyother special group. The miracle of spirit is that it can giveitself utterly to all these things and yet remain unimpaired,unexhausted, undivided. I am not a serial story to be read only inthe different installments of my different groups. We do not givea part to one group and a part to another, but we give our whole toeach and the whole remains for every other relation. Life escapesits classifications and this is what some of the writers on grouporganization do not seem to understand. This secret of the spiritis the power of the federal principle. True federation multiplieseach individual. We have thought that federal government consistedof mechanical, artificial, external forms, but really it is thespirit which liveth and giveth life.  Let the pluralists accept this principle and they will no longertell us that they are torn by a divided allegiance. Let them carrytheir pragmatism a step further and they will see that it is onlyby actual living that we can understand an undivided allegiance.James tells us that "Reality falls in passing into conceptualanalysis; it mounts in living its own undivided life -- it buds andbourgeons, changes and creates." This is the way we must understandan undivided allegiance. I live forever the undivided life. As anindividual I am the undivided one, as the group-I, I am again theundivided one, as the state-I, I am the undivided one -- I amalways and forever the undivided one, mounting from height toheight, always mounting, always the whole of me mounting.
