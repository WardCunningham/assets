THE NEW STATEBy Mary Parker FollettThe Occupational Group:Chapter XXXIPolitical Pluralism and The True Federal StateIN the last two chapters I have taken up the two fundamental lawsof life -- the law of interpenetration and the law of multiples. (1) Sovereignty, we have seen, is the power generated within thegroup -- dependent on the principle of interpenetration. (2) Manjoins many groups -- in order to express his multiple nature. Thesetwo principles give us federalism.  Let us, before considering the conception of federalism indetail, sum up in a few sentences what has already been said ofthese two principles. The fundamental truth of life we have seen isself-perpetuating activity -- activity so regnant, so omnipresent,so all-embracing, that it banishes even the conception of anythingstatic from the world of being. Conscious evolution means that wemust discover the essential principle of this activity and see thatit is at work in the humblest of its modes, the smallest group ormeeting of even two or three. The new psychology has brought topolitical science the recognition of interpenetration and the"compounding of consciousness" as the very condition of all life.Our political methods must conform to life's methods. We mustunderstand and follow the laws of association that the state mayappear, that our own little purposes may be fulfilled.  _Little_purposes? Is there any great and small? The humblest man and theprice of his daily loaf -- is this a small matter -- it hangs uponthe whole world situation to-day. In order that the needs of thehumblest shall be satisfied, or in order that world purposes shallbe fulfilled -- it matters not which -- this principle of"compounding" must be fully recognized and embodied in ourpolitical methods. It is this vital intermingling which creates thereal individual and knits men into the myriad relations of life. Wewin through life our individuality, it is not presented to us atthe beginning to be exploited as we will. We win a multipleindividuality through our manifold relations.  In the workings ofthis dual law are rooted all of social and political progress, allthe hope and the potency of human evolution.  Only the federal state can express this dual principle ofexistence -- the compounding and the multiple compounding.  It isan incomplete understanding of this dual law which is responsiblefor the mistaken interpretation of federalism held by some of thepluralists: a conception which includes the false doctrines ofdivision of power, the idea that the group not the individualshould be the unit of the state, the old consent of governedtheory, an almost discarded particularism (group rights), and theworn-out balance theory.  The distributive sovereignty school assumes that the essential,the basic part of federalism is the division of power between thecentral and separate parts: while the parts may be considered asceding power to the central state, or the central state may beconsidered as granting power to the parts, yet in one form oranother federalism means a divided sovereignty.  Esmein saysdefinitely, "L'Etat fe'de'ratif. . . fractionne la souverainete'.... " [1]. No, it should unite sovereignty. There should be noabsolute division of power or conferring of power. The activity ofwhole and parts should be one.     1. Quoted by Duguit.  In spite of all our American doctrines of the end of theeighteenth century, in spite of our whole history of states-righttheory and sentiment, the division of sovereignty is not the mainfact of the United States government. From 1789 to 1861 the idea ofa divided sovereignty -- that the United States was a voluntaryagreement between free, sovereign and independent states, thatauthority was "divided" between nation and states -- dictated thehistory of the United States. The war of 1861 was fought (some ofthe pluralists seem not to know) to settle this question [1]. Thetwo ideas of federalism came to a death grapple in our Civil Warand the true doctrine triumphed. That war decided that the UnitedStates was not a delegated affair, that it had a "real" existence,and that it was sovereign, yet not sovereign over the states as anexternal party, for it is composed of the states, but sovereignover itself, merely over itself. You have not to be a mystic tounderstand this but only an American. Those who see in a federalunion a mere league with rights and powers granted to a centralgovernment, those who see in a federal union a balancing ofsovereign powers, do not understand true federalism. When weenumerate the powers of the states as distinct from the powers ofour national government, some people regard this distinction as adividing line between nation and states, but the true "federalist"is always seeing the relation of these powers to those of thecentral government. There are no absolute divisions in a truefederal union.     1. It must be remembered, however, that while in the Civil War     we definitely gave up the compact theory held by us since the     Mayflower compact, yet we did not adopt the organism theory.     The federal state we have tried and are trying to work out in     America is based on the principles of psychic unity described     in chapter X. The giving up of the "consent" theory does not     bring us necessarily to the organic theory of society.  Do we then want a central government which shall override theparts until they become practically non-existent? The momentfederalism attempts to transcend the parts it has become vitiated.Our Civil War was not, as some writers assert, the blow to states-rights and the victory of centralization. We shall yet, I believe,show that it was a victory for true federalism [1]. The UnitedStates is neither to ignore the states, transcend the states, norto balance the states, it is to _be_ the states in their unitedcapacity.     1. Duguit says that the United States confers the rights of a     state on a territory. No, it recognizes that which already     exists.  Of course it is true that many Americans do think of ourgovernment as a division of powers between central and localauthority, therefore there is as a matter of fact much balancing ofinterests. But as far as we are doing this at Washington it isexactly what we must get rid of. The first lesson for every memberof a federal government to learn is that the interests of thedifferent parts, or the interests of the whole and the interests ofthe parts, are never to be pitted against each other. As far as theUnited States represents an interpenetration of thought and feelingand interest and will, it is carrying out the aims of federalism.  We have not indeed a true federalism in the United States to-day;we are now learning the lesson of federalism. Some one must analyzefor us the difference between centralization and true federalism,which is neither nationalization, states-rights, nor balance, andthen we must work for true federalism. For the federal governmentto attempt to do that which the states should do, or perhaps evenare doing, means loss of force, and loss of education-by-experiencefor the states. On the other hand, not to see when federal actionmeans at the same time local development and national strength,means a serious retarding of our growth. It is equally true thatwhen the states attempt what the federal government alone shouldundertake, the consequence is general muddle.  And it is by no means a question only of what the federalgovernment should do and what it should not do. It is a question ofthe _way_ of doing. It is a question of guiding, where necessary,without losing local initiative or local responsibility. It is aquestion of so framing measures that true federation, notcentralization, be obtained. Recently, even before the war, thetendency has been towards increased federal action and federalcontrol, as seen, for instance, in the control of railroadtransportation, of vocational education etc. The latter is anexcellent example of the possibility of central action being truefederal and not nationalized action. The federal government uponapplication from a state grants to that state an amount forvocational education equal to what the state itself willappropriate. The administration of the fund rests with the state.The federal government thus makes no assumptions. It _recognizesexisting facts_. And it does not impose something from without. Thestate must understand its needs, must know how those needs can bestbe satisfied; it must take responsibility. The experience of onestate joins with the experience of other states to form acollective experience.  As we watch federalism being worked out in actual practice atWashington, we see in that practice the necessity of a distinctionwhich has been emphasized throughout this book as the contributionof contemporary psychology to politics: nationalization is theHegelian reconciliation, true federalism is the integration ofpresent psychology. This means a genuine integration of theinterests of all the parts.  If our present tendency is towardsnationalization, we must learn the difference between that andfederalism and change it into the latter. We need a new order ofstatesmen in the world to-day -- for our nation, for ourinternational league -- those who understand federalism.  But I have been talking of federalism as the integration of parts(the states). We should remember also, and this is of the greatestimportance, that the United States is not only to be the _states_in their united capacity, but it is to be all the men and women ofthe United States in _their_ united capacity. This it seemsdifficult for many Europeans to understand; it breaks across theirtraditional conception of federalism which has been a league, aconfederation of "sovereign" parts, not a true federal state. We ofMassachusetts feel ourselves not first children of Massachusettsand then through Massachusetts of the United States. We belongdirectly to the United States not merely through Massachusetts.True federalism means that the individual, not the group, is theunit. A true federal government acts directly on its citizens, notmerely through the groups.  America has not led the world in democracy through methods ofrepresentation, social legislation, ballot laws or industrialorganization. She has been surpassed by other countries in all ofthese. She leads the world in democracy because through federalismshe is working out the secret of the universe actively. Multiplecitizenship in its spontaneous unifying is the foundation of thenew state. Federalism and democracy go together, you do not decideto have one or the other as your fancy may be. We did not establishfederalism in the United States, we are growing federalism. Cohesion imposed upon us externally will lack in significance andduration. Federalism must live through: (1) the reality of thegroup, (2) the expanding group, (3) the ascending group or unifyingprocess.  The federal state is the unifying state. The politicalpluralists, following James, use the "trailing and" [1] argument toprove that we can never have a unified state, that there is alwayssomething which never gets included. I should use it to prove thatwe can and must have a unifying state, that this "and" is the veryunifying principle. The "trailing and" is the deepest truth ofpsychology. It is because of this "and" that our goal must alwaysbe the unified state -- the unified state to be attained throughthe federal form. Our spirit it is true is by nature federal, butthis means not infinite unrelation but infinite possibility ofrelation, not infinite strung-alongness but infinite seeking forthe unifying of the strung-alongness. I forever discoverundeveloped powers. This is the glory of our exhaustless nature. Weare the expression of the principle of endless growth, of endlessappearing, and democracy must, therefore, so shape its forms as toallow for the manifestation of each new appearing. I growpossibilities; new opportunities should always be arising to meetthese new possibilities.     1. "The word 'and' trails along after every sentence.     Something always escapes. . . . The pluralistic world is thus     more like a federal republic than like an empire or a     kingdom."  "A Pluralistic Universe," 321-322.  Then through group and group and ascending group I actualize moreand more. The "trailing and" is man's task for ever and ever -- todrag in more spirit, more knowledge, more harmony.  Federalism isthe only possible form for the state because it leaves room for thenew forces which are coming through these spiritual "ands," for themyriad centres of life which must be forever springing up, groupafter group, within a vital state. Our impulse is at one and thesame time to develop self and to transcend self. It is this evertranscending self which needs the federal state. The federal stateis not a unified state, I agree, but it is a unifying state, not a"strung-along" state.  Thus it is the federal state which expresses the two fundamentalprinciples of life -- the compounding of consciousness and theendless appearings of new forces.  I have said that the pluralists' mistaken interpretation offederalism includes the particularist notions of "consent" and"rights" and "balance," and that all these come from a falseconception of sovereignty. What does the new psychology teach us of"consent"? Power is generated within the true group not by one orseveral assuming authority and the others "consenting," but solelyby the process of intermingling.  Only by the same method can thetrue state be grown.  If divorce is to be allowed between the state and this group orthat, what are the grounds on which it is to be granted? Willincompatibility be sufficient? Are the manufacturing north andagricultural south of Ireland incompatible? Does a certain tradeassociation want, like Nora, a "larger life"? The pluralists openthe gates to too much. They wish to throw open the doors of thestate to labor: yes, they are right, but let them beware whatveiled shapes may slip between those open portals.  Labor mustindeed be included in the state, it is our most immediate task, butlet us ponder well the method.  The pluralists assume that the unified state must always claimauthority over "other groups" [1].     1. When they say that the passion for unity is the urge for a     dominant One, they think of the dominant One as outside.But as he who expresses the unity of my group has no authority overme but is simply the symbol and the organ of the group, so thatgroup which expresses the unity of all groups -- that is, the state-- should have no authority _as a separate group_, but only so faras it gathers up into itself the whole meaning of these constituentgroups. Just here is the crux of the disagreement between theupholders of the pluralistic and of the true monistic state: theformer think of the other groups as "coextensive" or"complementary" to the state -- the state is one of the groups towhich we owe obedience; to the latter they and all individuals arethe constituents of the state [1].             1. One of the pluralists says, "I cannot see that . . .     sovereignty is the unique property of any one association."     No, not sovereignty over "others," but sovereignty always     belongs to any genuine group; as groups join to form another     real group, the sovereignty of the more inclusive group is     evolved -- that is the only kind of state sovereignty which we     can recognize as legitimate.  (See ch. XXIX on "Political     Pluralism and Sovereignty.")  I have said that our progress is from Contract to Community [2].This those pluralists cannot accept who take the consent of thegroup as part of their theory of the state. They thereby keepthemselves in the contract stage of thinking, they thereby and inso far range themselves with all particularists [3].     2. See ch. XV.     3. Mr. Laski is an exception to many writers on "consent."     When he speaks of consent he is referring only to the actual     facts of to-day. Denying the sovereignty postulated by the     lawyers (he says you can never find in a community any one     will which is certain of obedience), he shows that as a matter     of fact the state sovereignty we have now rests on consent. I     do not wish to confuse the issue between facts of the present     and hopes for the future, but I wish to make a distinction     between the "sovereignty" of the present and the sovereignty     which I hope we can grow. This distinction is implicit in Mr.     Laski's book, but it is lacking in much of the writing on the     "consent of the governed."  Secondly, in the divided sovereignty theory the old particularistdoctrine of individual rights gives way merely to a new doctrine ofgroup rights, the "inherent rights" of trade-unions orecclesiastical bodies. "Natural rights" and "social compact" wenttogether; the "inherent rights" of groups again tend to make thefederal bond a compact [1]. The state resting on a numerical basis,composed of an aggregate of individuals, gives way only to a statestill resting on a numerical basis although composed now of groupsinstead of individuals. As in the old days the individuals were tobe "free," now the groups are to be "independent." These newparticularists are as zealous and as jealous for the group as anynineteenth-century "individualist" was for the individual. Mr.Barker, who warns us, it is true, against inherent rights which arenot adjusted to other inherent rights, nevertheless says, "If weare individualists now, we are corporate individualists. Ourindividuals are becoming groups. We no longer write Man _vs_. theState but The Group _vs_. the State." But does Mr. Barker reallythink it progress to write Group _vs_. the State ~ If the principleof individual _vs_. the state is wrong, what difference does itmake whether that individual is one man or a group of men? In sofar as these rights are based on function, we have an advance inpolitical theory; in so far as we can talk of group _vs_. thestate, we are held in the thralls of another form of socialatomism. It is the pluralists themselves who are always saying,when they oppose crowd-sovereignty, that atomism means anarchy.Agreed, but atomism in any form, of groups as well as individuals,means anarchy, and this they do not always seem to realize.     1. Wherever you have the social contract theory in any form,     and assent as the foundation of power, there is no social     process going on; the state is an arbitrary creation of men.      Group organization to-day must give up any taint whatever of     the social contract and rest squarely and fully on its     legitimate psychological basis.  Mr. Barker speaks of the present tendency "to restrict theactivity of the state in order to safeguard the rights of thegroups." Many pluralists and syndicalists are afraid of the statebecause for them the old dualism is unsolvable. But as I have triedto show in the chapter on "Our Political Dualism" that the rightsof the state and the citizen are never, ideally, incompatible, sonow we should understand that our present task is to develop thosepolitical forms within which rights of group and state can beapproaching coincidence.  As long as we settle down within any one group, we are in dangerof the old particularism. Many a trade unionist succumbs to thisdanger. Love of a group will not get us out of particularism. Wecan have egoism of the group as well as egoism of the individual.Indeed the group may have all the evils of the individual --aggrandizement of self, exploitation of others etc. Nothing willget us out of particularism but the constant recognition that anywhole is always the element of a larger whole. Group life has twomeanings, one as important as the other: (1) it looks in to its ownintegrated, coordinated activity, (2) it sees that activity inrelation to other activities, in relation to a larger whole ofwhich it is a part. The group which does not look out deterioratesinto caste. The group which thinks only of itself is a menace tosociety; the group which looks to its manifold relations is part ofsocial progress. President Wilson as head of a national group hasjust as clear a duty to other national groups as to his owncountry.  Particularism of the individual is dead, in theory if not inpractice. Let us not now fall into the specious error of clingingto our particularism while changing its name from individual togroup.  The outcome of group particularism is the balance of powertheory, perhaps the most pernicious part of the pluralists'doctrine. The pluralist state is to be composed of sovereigngroups. What is their life to be? They are to be left alone tofight, to compete, or, word most favored by this school, tobalance. With de Maeztu the balance of power is confessedly thecorner-stone of the new state. "The dilemma which would make uschoose between the State and anarchy is false. There is anotheralternative, that of plurality and the balance of powers, notmerely within the nation but in the family of nations" [1].     1. This is perhaps a remnant of the nineteenth-century myth     that competition is the mode of progress.  But whenever you have balance in your premise, you have anarchyin your conclusion.  The weakness of the reasoning involved in the balance of powerargument has been exposed in so much of the war literature of thelast three years, which has exploded the balance of power theorybetween nations, that little further criticism is needed here.Unity must be our aim today. When you have not unity, you havebalance or struggle or domination -- of one over others. Thenations of Europe refuse domination, aim at balance, and war is theresult.  It seems curious that these two movements should be going on sideby side: that we are giving up the idea of the balance of nations,that we are refusing to think any longer in terms of "sovereign"nations, and yet at the same time an increasing number of menshould be advocating balancing, "sovereign" groups within nations.The pluralists object to unity, but unity and plurality are surelynot incompatible. The true monistic state is merely the multiplestate working out its own unity from infinite diversity.  But theunifying state shows us what to do with that diversity. Whatadvantage is that diversity if it is to be always "competing,""fighting," "balancing?" Only in the unifying state do we get thefull advantage of diversity where it is gathered up intosignificance and pointed action.  The practical outcome of the balance theory will be firstantagonistic interests, then jealous interests, then competinginterests, then dominating interests -- a fatal climax.  The trouble with the balance theory is that by the time therepresentatives of the balancing groups meet, it is too late toexpect agreement. The chief objection to pluralism is, perhaps,that it is usually merely a scheme of representation, that itsadvocates are usually talking of the kind of roof they want beforethey have laid the foundation stones. No theory of the state canhave vitality which is merely a plan of representation. The newstate must rest on a new conception of living, on a trueunderstanding of the vital modes of association. The reason whyoccupational representation must bring balance and competition isbecause the integrating of differences, the essential socialprocess, does not take place far enough back in our life. IfParliaments are composed of various groups or interests, theunification of those interests has to take place in Parliament. Butthen it is too late. The ideas of the different groups must mingleearlier than Parliament. We must go further back than ourlegislatures for the necessary unifying. We do not wantlegislatures full of opposing interests. The ideas of the groupsbecome too crystallized by the time their representatives get tothe Parliament, in fact they have often hardened into prejudices.Moreover, the representatives could not go against theirconstituencies, they would be pledged to specific measures. Thedifferent groups would come together each to try to prevail, not togo through the only genuine democratic process, that of trying tointegrate their ideas and interests.  When the desire to prevail is once keenly upon us, we behave verydifferently than when our object is the seeking of truth. SupposeI am the representative in Congress of a group or a party. A billis under consideration.  I see a weakness in that bill; if I pointit out some one else may see a remedy for it and the bill may beimmensely improved. But do I do this? Certainly not. I am so afraidof the bill being lost if I show any weakness in it that I keepthis insight to myself and my country loses just so much. I cannotbelieve that occupational representation will foster truth seekingor truth speaking. It seems to me quite a case of the frying paninto the fire. Compromise and swapping will be the order inParliaments based solely on the vocational principle. The differentinterests must fight it out in Parliament. This is fundamentallyagainst democracy because it is against the psychologicalfoundation of democracy, the fundamental law of association.Democracy depends on the blending, not the balancing, of interestsand thoughts and wills. Occupational representation assumes thatyou secure the interests of the whole by securing the interests ofevery class, the old particularist fallacy transferred to thegroup.  Moreover, it is often assumed that because the occupational groupis composed of men of similar interests we shall have agreement inthe occupational group; it is taken for granted that in theseeconomic groups the agreement of opinion necessary for voting willbe automatic. But do poets or carpenters or photographers thinkalike on more than a very few questions? What we must do is to getbehind these electoral methods to some fundamental method whichshall _produce_ agreement.  Moreover, if the Cabinet were made up of these warring elements,administration would be almost impossible. Lloyd-George's Cabinetat present is hampered by too much "difference." I have throughout,to be sure, been advocating the compounding of difference as thesecret of politics, but the compounding must begin further back inour life than Parliaments or Cabinets.  And if you had group representation in England would not theCabinet be made up of the most powerful of the groups, and wouldnot a fear of defeat at any particular time mean overtures toenough of the other groups to make success in the Cabinet? Andwould not an entirely improper amount of power drift to the Premierunder these circumstances? Have we any leaders who would, could anyone trust himself to, guide the British Cabinet for the bestinterests of Great Britain under such conditions as these?  To sum up: a true federalism cannot rest on balance orgroup-rights or consent. Authority, obedience, liberty, can neverbe understood without an understanding of the group process. Someof the advocates of guild socialism oppose function to authorityand liberty, but we can have function _and_ liberty _and_authority: authority of the whole through the liberty of all bymeans of the functions of each. These three are inescapably united.A genuine group, a small or large group, association or state, hasthe right to the obedience of its members. No group should besovereign over another group. The only right the state has toauthority over "other" groups is as far as those groups areconstituent parts of the state. All groups are not constituentparts of the state to-day, as the pluralists clearly see. Possiblyor probably all groups never will be, but such perpetuallyself-actualizing unity should be the process.  Groups are sovereignover themselves, but in their relation to the state they areinterdependent groups, each recognizing the claims of every other.Our multiple group life is the fact we have to reckon with; unityis the aim of all our seeking. And with this unity will appear asovereignty spontaneously and joyfully acknowledged.  In truefederalism, voided of division and balance, lies such sovereignty.
