  <h1>Federated Wiki Assets</h1>
  <p>Here we share from GitHub pages assets that are alredy available via http from various sites owned by Ward Cunningham.</p>
  <h3>Examples</h3>
  <p>Consider the <a href=http://cube.fed.wiki/cube-of-justice.html>Cube of Justice</a> wiki page that includes a Frame script animating a glowing cube coded in ThreeJS.
  This is served from wiki as an html script <a href=http://cube.fed.wiki/assets/pages/cube-of-justice/cube.html>cube.html</a>
  and again as <a href=http://cube.fed.wiki/assets/pages/cube-of-justice/cube.html>index.html</a>
  for use as the site's custom home page <a href=http://cube.fed.wiki/>cube.fed.wiki</a>).
  Both of these files are again served here on GitHub over https as <a href=https://wardcunningham.github.io/assets/pages/cube-of-justice/cube.html>cube.html</a>
  and <a href=https://wardcunningham.github.io/assets/pages/cube-of-justice/index.html>index.html</a>.</p>
